# Host Scripts

These are to setup a few things:
1. native ssh configuration options to access the vagrant VMs without `vagrant ssh` which is faster than the overhead of vagrant... and... 
2. config options are needed to then setup docker contexts for each docker daemon on the VMs for ease of access remotely (on host), also to make exercises more sane in this course to avoid `ssh` all the time to poke around a node
3. Cleanup/verify the scripts are working
